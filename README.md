# Basic Calculator App (Android)
This android application is a basic calculator. It can perform both integer and double operations over addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the user can flip the sign of a number, delete individual digits from the end of a number, and clear the screen. The methodology for this app was to implement a very simple Model-View Controller design to make the app respond to various button clicks. The outcome of this app is a functioning basic calculator that can perform four arithmetic operations, which the user interacts with by pressing buttons in order to calculate with integers and doubles.

## Description
In this project, Android Studio and the Java programming language was used to create a basic calculator app. The purpose was to gain experience and knowledge of how a mobile app for android is structured. For this project, the goal was to learn how two major pieces interact with each other -- the XML file (front-end user experience and UI) and the Java file (to perform actions based on user interaction with the app). The result is a basic four-function calculator utilizing a basic Model-View Controller structural design in order to perform tasks. It covers the following functions: 
1)  Basic  arithmetic  calculations  (add,  subtract,  multiply,  
divide)  
2)  Clearing  what  is  on  screen  
3)  Deleting  single  digits  (back  button)  
4)  Flipping  the  sign  of  the  current  number  on  screen  
5)  Supports  both  ints  and  doubles
